A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a software architectural style for creating web services that allow different systems to communicate with each other over the internet. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform operations on resources. Here's a summary:

Architecture: REST APIs follow a client-server architecture where clients make requests to access or modify resources on the server. Resources are identified by unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
Statelessness: REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary to understand and fulfill the request. This allows for scalability and reliability.
HTTP Methods: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods:
GET: Retrieve a resource.
POST: Create a new resource.
PUT: Update an existing resource or create a new one.
DELETE: Remove a resource.
PATCH: Partially update a resource.
OPTIONS: Retrieve information about supported methods and other details about the API.
Data Formats: REST APIs typically support various data formats for representing resources, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language).
Authentication and Authorization: REST APIs often use authentication mechanisms such as API keys, OAuth, or JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure access to resources. Authorization mechanisms control what actions a client can perform on specific resources.
Response Codes: HTTP status codes are used to indicate the success or failure of a request. Common codes include 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).
Documentation: Good REST APIs provide comprehensive documentation that describes the available endpoints, supported methods, request and response formats, authentication requirements, and error handling.
